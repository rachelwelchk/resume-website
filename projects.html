        <h2>PRODUCT MARKETING ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION:</h2>
        <p>
            You are a product manager who has managed the creation of a new high-tech travel coffee mug. The coffee mug
            was designed for on-the-go people, traveling for work, and other long adventures. The coffee mug that your
            team has created was designed to keep coffee at the perfect temperature for up to 8 hours. The mug reads the
            temperature and will heat itself up every half hour based on the rolling temperature. Consider the
            technology that may have gone into the travel mug and who would use a high-tech mug.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now it is up to your team to market and send product messaging to the correct target audience. Consider the
            functionality and usability as expressed in the Value Matrix we discussed in the lesson, and how this will
            affect the market segments your team will be addressing. Before you can send out messaging, you must
            identify your target audience using an empathy map and developing personas to create the best story.

        <h2>PRODUCT DESIGN ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION:</h2>
        <p>You are a product manager at a startup that is developing tools for creators. You are working with a small
            design team with two dedicated designers assigned to this project. You also have three software developers
            who are working with your team. Your team uses Figma to collaborate for design iterations. Your team also
            uses Adobe Illustrator to create static assets.</p>
        <p>Your goal in this portfolio assessment is to follow the end-to-end design process to come up with a Minimum
            Viable Product (MVP) to build. First, you have to come up with a vision and mission statement for your
            group. That vision feeds into your specific business and product goals. You also need to narrow down your
            focus to a specific user segment to start your initial iterations. After that, come up with a prioritized
            list of needs for those users. For a prioritized need, create three solutions to serve those needs. Out of
            those three solutions, choose one and build a prototype that can be tested with the initial set of users.
